// it is not a good practise to assign a type to a varibale if we are already giving the value to that variable as typescript is smart enough to understand the type of that value.
var num = 100;
var str = "it's a string";
var auth = true;
// it is ok to not assign type to a variable in every case if the variable is asigned a value 
var numTwo = 200;
var strTwo = "second string";
var authentication = false;
