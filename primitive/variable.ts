// it is not a good practise to assign a type to a varibale if we are already giving the value to that variable as typescript is smart enough to understand the type of that value.

let num: number = 100;
let str: string = "it's a string";
let auth: boolean = true;


// it is ok to not assign type to a variable in every case if the variable is asigned a value 

let numTwo = 200;
let strTwo = "second string";
let authentication = false;
